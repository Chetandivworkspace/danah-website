It is true that any kind of enterprise we want to engage in requires some kind of financial wealth if it is to succeed in the short term. But for leadership to inspire long-term, sustainable enterprises, it needs to pursue two other forms of capital as well: social and spiritual.

This is not about religion or spiritual practices. Rather, this is about the power a leader to achieve record results by inspiring people’s deepest meanings, values, and purposes.
