    "excerpt": "Thought leader, author and philosopher Danah Zohar tells Sidhi Chadha that spirituality is much deeper than what's perceived. People are losing grip on their lives, which has resulted in sudden attention to the ages-old mysticism. Excerpts from an interview: Although the philosophy of spirituality is age old, why has it come to occupy our minds in a prominent way these days? Spirituality has become more popular of late because the older generation probably lost the grip of living life. Today, lifestyle has become stressful and people are looking for something that can fill the gap. It's a fight against materialism.",
