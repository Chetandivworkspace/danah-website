IQ is a measure of our rational, logical, rule-bound, abstract problem-solving intelligence and refers to a style of rational, goal-oriented thinking. In the mid-1990s, emotional intelligence (EQ) was increasingly seen as important: as Daniel Goleman defines it, EQ enables us to assess the situation we are in and then to behave appropriately within it, particularly to respond appropriately to the emotions of others. ",r.a.createElement("br",null),r.a.createElement("br",null),"What is common to both IQ and EQ is that both intelligences enable us to play within the boundaries—to play “finite games”. The work of Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall demonstrates the importance of spiritual intelligence (SQ), which enables us to think “outside of the box” and to play with the boundaries—to play an “infinite game”. SQ is a transformative intelligence that allows us to break old paradigms and to invent new ones, to reframe problems and situations, to dissolve old patterns and to be open to finding new ones. SQ also represents our access to and need for deep meaning, fundamental values and a sense of purpose, and the extent to which these influence our decisions and actions. It has the force to address lower motivations and to shift us towards higher motivations.
